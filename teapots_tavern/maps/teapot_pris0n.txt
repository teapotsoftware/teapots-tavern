Welcome to MUFF Security, cupcake.
Proud to be Nebraska's safest private penal company.
You might wonder wh there's so many guns layin' around.
We like to tempt our prisoners to pick 'em up and forfeit their rights.
That means we can just shoot 'em, no paperwork! One less meal to cook.
Same thing if they find their way outside our confines.
It sure is fun shootin' unarmed men on the run...
The best part is they keep sendin' em so long as we keep shootin' em!
But hey, lighten up, new guy. We let ya smoke in the medical bay.
